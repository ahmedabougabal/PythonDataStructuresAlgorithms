# Trees
- trees are used to store information.
- tree is usually upside down.
- each circle is called a node or a vertex.
- link between 2 nodes is an edge.

- from the above tree, we deduce the following. . .
- the edge is the distance (connection) between 2 nodes, node 5 has no edge with node 4
- [Tree with n nodes has n - 1 edges](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/spa/courses/sa12/mod8.pdf)
- the tree has 4 levels, levels (0,1,2,3)
- Node(1) has 2 children: 2 and 3
- The parent of Node(7) is node(2)
- Nodes {5, 9} are siblings (brothers)
- height (specific to each node) represents the number of edges on the longest downward path between a node(vertex) and a leaf.
- Tree of N levels has N-1 heights, since that the tree above has 4 levels, then the height is 4-1 = 3 edges
- the height of the node 1 (root) is 3 (start from the root to the longest path downward to the farest leaf)
- node 7 has a height = 0
- Node's Depth : the number of edges from the node to the root node.
  ***Difference between Depth and Height***
  - depth is specific about 2 nodes (root node and the current node only)
  - height is going down from the node to the leaves. (height is about my current node and any other node (leaf) i can reach - longest path)
- there is only 1 path between any 2 nodes. (you are now at the root node and you wanted to go to the node 4, then there is only 1 way (simple tree)
- in a tree where every node has only 1 single parent, then there is only 1 path from a node to another.

**Sub Trees**
- recursive nature where each tree has a subtree and each subtree has another subtree.
- Problem solving tip: we deduce that when we want to get the elements of a tree, we will do this recursively.


# Binary Trees
- a tree where each node at least has at most 2 children (left and right nodes).
- a leaf node is a node with no children.

**this is a simple tree (a node has many children)**

**this is a binary tree (each node has at most 2 children)**

-- A linked List is a special case of a binary tree.
